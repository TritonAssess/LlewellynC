TritonMVC
Sample code for Triton

This is a sample program for Triton.

I have used a couple of techniques, utlising both Depedency Injection and instantiaton when required. Due to time constraints I have not added input validation.

Installation Instructions
Download the zip file. Extract to a folder and load into Visual Studio. Download the database TritonDB file and restore this into Sqlserver. If the user is not created, please create the user UserName : webuser Password : webuser

Alternatively if you assign a seperate user to the database please modify the connection string in Services/Database.

Run the application and use the menu options in the navigation bar to access the functions.
